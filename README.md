Repliqode -- Replicode UI
=========================

![screenshot](/doc/screenshot.png)

Not very complete yet, but allows you to load and run .replicode files, and
tries to visualize the rmem.

## Building

To build just open repliqode.pro in QtCreator, or run qmake && make manually
from the command line. If you don't have replicode installed globally, copy the
config.pri.example file to config.pri and adjust the paths to your local
replicode installation and build directory.
